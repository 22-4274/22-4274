Employment History: 
Pentax Medical, April 2022 - August 2023, Technical Administrator 
 
o Demonstrated resourcefulness, attention to detail, and effective 
problem-solving skills in ensuring efficient day-to-day operations. 
▪ When a new sales order was placed with the medical 
equipment supplier for a hospital client, I worked closely with 
the customer to resolve an issue with the order's production 
date. By analysing the supplier's system and applying my 
knowledge of cloud-based workflows, I was able to identify the 
root cause of the problem and provide a revised solution. This 
ensured that the order was fulfilled on time and met the client's 
needs.

ensure a seamless fulfilment of orders from various customers. 
By using my knowledge of Amazon's logistics platform and 
working closely with my team, we were able to identify 
bottlenecks in our workflow and implement process 
improvements that increased productivity by 25%. As a result, 
we met or exceeded our sales targets for that period. 
Visit by GES, May 2017 - October 2021, Support Engineer

for supporting a team of engineers who were setting up and 
testing the lighting rigs for the event. To ensure a smooth 
operation, I collaborated with the team to develop a detailed 
plan for equipment setup, including coordinating with local 
electrical suppliers and arranging transportation services. This 
required effective communication, problem-solving, and 
attention to detail to meet the tight deadline.
